      let's get to work.\u201D"
    - "Mother:\n\u201CDo you see that tree over there? That is the source of the
      corruption that is spreading from here. But be careful so you don't fall down.\u201D"
    - "Mother:\n\u201COnce you reach the tree you will have to use the spirit dash
      to destroy it. It is the only way to stop it from spreading its vile stench.\u201D"
    - "Mother:\n\u201CNow go. There is not much time. Once you destroy it I will
      take you back to the mortal realm.\u201D"
    - "Mother:\n\u201CGood luck my child.\u201D"
