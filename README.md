# Alter (working name Dark)

In this third-person platformer set in a mysterious and spiritual realm, you are on a journey of ridding a dark world from its corruption and eventual decay.  

The world has changed. Nature is slowly dying. The spirit realm is in chaos. The fate of the world rests on the shoulders of a young girl. As the powers of her mother flows through her, she travels the land, helping her mother restore balance. But is everything really as it seems?

In Alter you set out on a mission to cleanse the world from corruption. To succeed in this task, you must learn how to traverse a large world using the powers gifted to you by the spirit mother, Keres and travel to ancient spirit worlds where you will destroy the trees causing corruption. With the abilities to jump high and to use the spirit dash, you will be able to reach places normal humans will not. Once you enter the spirit world you will be faced with more challenging platforming and puzzles to solve.

Alter was developed in Unity in seven weeks as a part of a game project at Futuregames, a higher vocational education for game development, in Stockholm, Sweden.
